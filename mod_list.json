            "description": "# Rebalanced Stakes\n\nThis mod aims to provide a more engaging and balanced difficulty curve for Balatro's higher Stakes, particularly addressing the often-criticized `-1 Discard` penalty of the vanilla Blue Stake. As acknowledged by LocalThunk, that modifier could feel overly punishing and have limited the viability of bigger size poker hands; this mod offers an alternative approach while that change is pending in the vanilla game.\n\n## How It Works\nInstead of introducing entirely new harsh mechanics early on, this mod shifts existing shop Joker limitations (Perishable, Rental) to earlier Stakes (Blue and Orange, respectively). The Gold Stake is then redesigned to offer a distinct economic and endurance challenge.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Blue Stake (Stake 5):**\n    - Removes the `-1 Discard` penalty\n    - Introduces Perishable Jokers to the shop pool *(effect moved from vanilla Orange Stake)*\n    - Perishable Jokers become negative when they expire alongside being debuffed\n\n- **Orange Stake (Stake 7):**\n    - Removes the Perishable Joker effect\n    - Introduces Rental Jokers to the shop pool *(effect moved from vanilla Gold Stake)*\n\n- **Gold Stake (Stake 8):**\n    - Removes the Rental Joker effect\n    - Introduces two significant new challenges:\n        - **Increased Interest Threshold:** You now need **_$6_** (up from **_$5_**) to earn each dollar of interest.\n        The interest cap scales accordingly (_$30_ -> _$60_ -> _$120_) so you can still gain up to _$5_, _$10_ _(Seed Money)_ and _$20_ _(Money Tree)_\n        - **Increased Run Length:** The Final Ante required to win is increased to **Ante 9** _(up from Ante 8)_\n\n## Installation\n1. **Requirements**: Download and install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)\n2. **Download**: Get the latest version of Rebalanced Stakes from the releases\n3. **Install Location**: Extract to `%appdata%\\Balatro\\Mods` on Windows\n\n## Design Notes\nThe goal is a smoother ramp-up of difficulty, without limiting the hand types you can play while also having a challenging final stake that tests your economic management and run longevity rather than just adding more restrictions.\n\n*Note: On gold stake, instead of the interest rework, at first I tried removing the rewards of big blind. Turns out it was an even more awful experience than -1 discard. The greatly reduced money income coupled with rental jokers was just brutal.*\n\n## Support\nSuggestions and feedback are welcome! Let me know what you think of the rebalanced progression.\n"

So here's this! There's almost nothing to it, this mod simply replaces the background shaders with an edited version that removes the pixelation effect.\nThis mod is compatible with any other mods that change the background colors, like [Cryptid](github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid) or [Cardsauce](https://github.com/BarrierTrio/Cardsauce).\nIf you wanna go crazy with making your own custom swirling balatro vortex desktop background, i reccomend getting [DebugPlus](https://github.com/WilsontheWolf/DebugPlus) and [Cardsauce](https://github.com/BarrierTrio/Cardsauce) and setting the background colors to your liking, then hide the UI with H!\n"

            "description": "# QOL Bundle\n\nA collection of quality-of-life improvements for Balatro.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis mod provides several small adjustments to gameplay mechanics to enhance the overall experience, particularly when using other mods that add new content.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Easier Wheel of Fortune**: Configurable ease for the Wheel of Fortune tarot card. Adjust the chance of hitting the desired outcome (1 = 100% chance, 4 = vanilla 25% chance). Default is 3.\n- **Wildcard Fix**: Prevents Wildcard and Smeared Joker from being negatively affected by suit debuffs when they could match a non-debuffed suit. When Paperback mod is installed, Smeared Joker considers light suits and dark suits, respectively, as the same suit.\n- **Increased Shop Size**: Increases the base shop size by 1 (default is 2). This helps offset the dilution of the shop pool caused by other mods adding new cards and items.\n- **Unweighted Base Editions**: Makes Foil, Holo, and Polychrome editions equally likely when rolled, while preserving the original probability of Negative editions.\n- **Configurable 8 Ball Joker**: Adjust the chance of the 8 Ball Joker spawning Tarot cards (1 = 100% chance, 4 = vanilla 25% chance). Default is 4.\n- **Reworked Hit the Road Joker**: When enabled, discarded Jacks are returned to the deck alongside the current effect.\n- **Square Joker Modification**: Reworks the Square Joker to give +4 chips if played hand has exactly 4 cards, with each scoring card having a 1 in 2 chance to add +4 more chips. Also changes rarity to Uncommon.\n- **Flower Pot Wildcard Rework**: Flower Pot only appears in shop when Wildcard-enhanced cards exist in deck and triggers when scoring hand contains any Wildcard.\n- **Baron Uncommon**: Makes Baron joker Uncommon rarity with reduced cost ($5 instead of $8).\n- **Mime Rare**: Makes Mime joker Rare rarity with increased cost ($6 instead of $5).\n- **Satellite Joker Rework**: Satellite now gives gold equal to half the highest poker hand level (rounded up).\n- **Controlled Sigil**: Sigil now requires selecting a card first and converts all cards to selected card's suit instead of random suit.\n- **Controlled Ouija**: Ouija now requires selecting a card first and converts all cards to selected card's rank instead of random rank.\n- **Loyalty Card Rounds Mode**: Loyalty Card triggers based on rounds instead of hands played for more predictable timing and easier to plan around.\n- **Splash Joker Retrigger**: Splash Joker additionally retriggers two random scoring cards.\n- **Ceremonial Dagger Common**: Makes Ceremonial Dagger joker Common rarity with reduced cost ($3 instead of $6).\n- **Mail-In Rebate Uncommon**: Makes Mail-In Rebate joker Uncommon rarity (was Common rarity - makes it rarer).\n- **Fortune Teller Cheaper**: Makes Fortune Teller joker cheaper (cost $4 instead of $6).\n- **Erosion X Mult Rework**: Changes Erosion from +4 Mult per card to X0.15 Mult per card below starting amount.\n- **Interest on Skip**: Gain interest when skipping blinds, calculated and awarded before obtaining the tag.\n- **Paperback Compatibility**: Added compatibility for Paperback mod's Jester of Nihil joker and suit considerations for Smeared Joker.\n- **Nerf Hanging Chad**: Makes Hanging Chad joker Uncommon rarity and more expensive (cost $7 instead of $6).\n- **Castle Checkered Reliability**: Castle now counts either Clubs and Spades or Hearts and Diamonds, making it as reliable as in the checkered deck. If Paperback mod is installed, light suits or dark suits will be used instead.\n- **Yorick Enhancement**: Yorick now gains a configurable amount (+1.5x for each 23 cards instead of +1x).\n- **Reworked Magic Trick and Illusion Vouchers**: \n    - Magic Trick is now a \"better\" Illusion voucher with playing cards in shop appearing with enhancements, editions and seals (actually spawn instead of the bugged vanilla). \n    - Illusion now shows cards that are clones of cards in your deck with ability to reroll their enhancements, editions, and seals (but never lose them).\n    - Improved shop card pricing accounts for enhancements, editions, and seals. Baseline is more expensive and can go up to $6\n    - **Paper Clips Support**: Magic Trick and Illusion vouchers now may apply paper clips to shop playing cards (same as seals) when Paperback mod is installed.\n\n## Installation\n\n1.  **Requirements**: Download and install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)\n2.  **Download**: Get the latest version of QOL Bundle from the releases\n3.  **Install Location**: Extract to `%appdata%\\Balatro\\Mods` on Windows\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, suggestions, or contributions, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gfreitash/balatro-mods).\n"

Gem Slots can be obtained in multiple ways, and can hold Gemstones.\n\n## How do I get Gemstones?\nGemstones can be found from either the shop or a Gemstone Booster Pack, which contains 3 Gemstone cards and a copy of The Infusion tarot. There are other ways as well, such as from a The Excavator tarot or from a tag.\n\n## How do I apply a Gemstone?\nYou can apply a Gemstone to a card or Joker (depending on what the description says) if it has a Gem Slot applied. If there is no Gem Slot, you can apply one by using a new tarot called The Infusion, which applies an Empty Gem Slot to 2 highlighted cards or Jokers.\n\n## Extra Content\nThere is extra content built around the mod that can be enabled/disabled from the Conifg. The extra content are Jokers, Tags, Challenges, Vouchers, Blinds, and Decks."

All jokers and their art were personally developed by me, with a great amount of dev help from the Balatro Discord #modding-dev channel.\n\nSteamodded **[1.0.0-beta-0827c](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta-0827c)** or later is required.\n\nList of Jokers (Modded Wiki Page): https://balatromods.miraheze.org/wiki/Pi_cubed's_Jokers/Jokers\n\nDocumentation spreadsheet (Planned content, patch notes, & more info): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1s2MFswjKUeVcx3W0Cylmya1ZfFvx2fiQZD42ZThxd5Q/edit?usp=sharing\n\nDiscord discussion thread: https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1348621804696240201\n\npi_cubed's Jokers is a relatively lightweight mod with minimal lovely patching and hooks. As a result, there should be few crashes due to conflicts with other mods. Feel free to reach out to me via the link above if problems do occur!\n\n## Config Options\nA game restart is required for Config options to take effect.\n\n### New Spectral Cards  \nThis option enables or disables the Spectral Cards Commander, Rupture, and Extinction from appearing.\n\n### New Tags\nThis option enables or disables the Rebound Tag from appearing.\n\n### Custom Sound Effects  \nEnables or disables any custom sound effects I've implemented into the mod. Currently, this affects Rhythmic Joker, Explosher, On-beat, Off-beat, Pot, Talking Flower, \"Monkey See, Monkey Do\", Otamatone, and Panic Fire.\n\n### Hand type-affecting Jokers\nEnables or disables any Jokers that directly change your hand and what poker hands it contains. Certain mods that tinker with poker hands can cause crashes or game closures when these Jokers activate.

Download and install, [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)\n\n2. [Ignore this step if you're downloading via the mod manager] Download the desired ProjectMoonTexturePack.zip file from Releases on the right menu (default has black backgrounds for playing cards, WhiteVersion has white backgrounds), extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the ProjectMoonTexturePack folder and there's an assets, localization and .lua file inside\n\n3. [Optional] Repeat step 2 for the ProjectMoonMusicAddon.zip if you desire to include the music\n   \n5. [Optional] If you want to add the custom Balatro logo, you'll have to use 7zip to open up the Balatro.exe file located in the installation folder (Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Balatro), navigate to resources -> textures -> 1x and replace the Balatro logo there. I provided the custom Balatro.png in my mod folder, inside the assets folder\n\n6. Go to Options -> Texture click on the custom Eternal sprite and hit Enable. It'll move up top, meaning the custom Spectral textures are enabled\n\n7. Enjoy the mod!\n\n\n## Known issues\n\n- Certain UI elements are still using the old colour schemes\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to Novell, [Dawni](https://x.com/hidawnihere), Sans, Simon and Oath for testing out the mod and giving suggestions!\n\nAlso thanks to [DB](https://x.com/Despair_Bears) for showcasing my work on Twitter and in Detroit and everyone in the RegretfulDiscord and MentalBlock servers for the support!\n"

Thanks to Virtualized for helping me get their server up to date and supporting this mod.\n\n## How does damage even calculate?\n\nBasically the more digits in your final score for the round, the higher your attack.  100 points starts off at 1 damage, and every 10x to that score equals 4 more points of damage.  Or about 1.75x mult equals 1 point of damage."

            "description": "> [!CAUTION]\n> DEPRECATED. This mod is made for compatibility with an old format for DeckSkins that is no longer used. As such, it is no longer being updated and I will not be giving any more support for it in the Balatro discord. **It will still work**, but I do not reccomend using it. If you can, PLEASE avoid using this, and use the DeckSkin API built into SMODS instead. It may be a bit more complicated, but it provides a much better system with many new features and optimizations. [Check out the SMODS Wiki Page for it here](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki/SMODS.DeckSkin).\n\n# DeckSkinsLite\n\nA mod for Balatro that simplifies the creation of custom skins for your deck. Custom Deck skins are automatically loaded from the mod's skins folder into the game.\n\n## Creating New Deck Skins\n\nAll you need is a small .lua file that contains a table of variables in the /skins/ folder, and a 2 textures in the /assets/ folder (a 1x and 2x version).\nCheck the /.example/ folder for more details on how DeckSkinsLite add-ons are formatted, [or check the Documentation for more details!](https://github.com/Kekulism/DeckSkinsPlus/wiki/Skin-Documentation)\n\n## Credits\n\nHuge thanks to [OneSuchKeeper]([https://github.com/onesuchkeeper]) for converting the previous version of this mod, DeckSkins+, into an API inside Steammodded! Now DeckSkins can be added by anyone even if they don't use this mod :)\n"

But I didn't stop there; I kept making more and more for fun, and the more I made, the more motivated I was to finish it all.\nI had several difficulties and even gave up a few times, but I remembered that I made this mod with passion, and in the end, I finished it.\n\nI really liked the result, and although it's not the best mod ever or as good as Cryptid, I think it's original and creative.\nThe idea of \u200b\u200bthe Jokers being evil when you buy or obtain them makes the game more challenging, so it's not an easy mod.\n\n## Description\nThis mod adds all 150 Balatro Jokers in their evil versions. You can obtain them when you purchase any Joker, and there's a 50% chance you'll get either the evil or normal version. \nI'm not sure if it works with Balatro seeds, but I think you're relying on luck to complete this mod. The odds can't be changed within the mod itself, and you'll only discover the Joker as you play.\n\nCurrently, the mod only has three Jokers that cannot appear in their evil versions: Evil Luchador, and Evil Chicot.\n\nI believe I've included all the other Jokers without any errors or bugs that could crash your game. If you find a bug or problem, I'm not sure how to report it, but I'll try to fix them if I find them.\n\nThe mod will eventually include all the game's content in its \"evil\" version, so I have a lot of work to do.\n\n\nThat's all I think, and thanks for playing my mod.\n"

            "description": "# Brainstorm Rerolled\nThis is a fork of both [Brainstorm](https://github.com/OceanRamen/Brainstorm) created by [OceanRamen](https://github.com/OceanRamen) as well as [Immolate](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Immolate) please give credit to them as I have simply modified the hard work they did\n\n# /!\\ Not compatible with macOS /!\\\n\n## Description\nThis repository houses both the code for the brainstorm mod as well as the code for the C++ version of the Immolate seed finder. If you would like to create your own filters simply \nadd the code to the Immolate.cpp file, update the brainstorm endpoints to include whatever you need and then build it. This will generate a dll\nthat you can then place in the mods folder of balatro. The brainstorm mod will automatically detect the dll and use it, though you will need to update the brainstorm.lua and ui.lua \nin order to properly use your new options\n\n## Features\n### Save-States\nBrainstorm has the capability to save up to 5 save-states through the use of in-game key binds. \n> To create a save-state: Hold `z + 1-5`\n> To load a save-state:\tHold `x + 1-5`\n\nEach number from 0 - 5 corresponds to a save slot. To overwrite an old save, simply create a new save-state in it's slot. \n\n### Fast Rerolling\nBrainstorm allows for super-fast rerolling through the use of an in-game key bind. \n> To fast-roll:\tPress `Ctrl + r`\n\n### Auto-Rerolling\nBrainstorm can automatically reroll for parameters as specified by the user.\nYou can edit the Auto-Reroll parameters in the Brainstorm in-game settings page.\n> To Auto-Reroll:\tPress `Ctrl + a`\n\n### Various Filters\nIn addition to the original filters from brainstorm I have added a few more filters that can help facilitate Crimson Bean or simply an easy early game  \n\nANTE 8 BEAN: This ensures you get a Turtle Bean within the first 150 items in the shop  \nLATE BURGLAR: This ensures there is a burglar within the first 50-150 cards in the ante 6, 7, or 8 shop  \nRETCON: This ensures that the retcon voucher appears before or in ante 8  \nEARLY COPY + MONEY: This ensures that between the shop and the packs in ante 1 you get a brainstorm, blueprint, and some form of money generation\n\n### Custom Filtering\nI have added some basic code and an example to go off of to create custom filters. I have set it up so that custom filters will override any other selected filter to avoid crashes. If you want to use\nthe mod as originally created simply keep the custom filters set to \"No Filter\". If you want to create your own custom filters you will need to edit immolate.cpp and immolate.hpp to add your custom filter similar to how I added the \"Negative Blueprint\" filter\nonce added there you can build it and then copy the resulting dll into the brainstorm mod folder. Then you need to update the ui.lua and brainstorm.lua too add your new filter to the list.\n\n#### Adding Custom Filters\n1. Open immolate.hpp\n\t1. Add the name of your new filter to `enum class customFilters`\n\t1. Add a new case in `inline std::string filterToString(customFilters f)` for your new filter\n\t1. add a new if statement in `inline customFilters stringToFilter(std::string i)` for your new filter\n1. Open immolate.cpp\n\t1. Add a new case in the switch statement for your filter to `long filter(Instance inst)`\n\t1. Add corresponding code inside of that case for your custom filter\n1. Save and build the C++ code and copy the resulting dll into the brainstorm mod folder\n1. Open ui.lua\n\t1. Add a new entry to the `local custom_filter_list` corresponding to your new filter\n\t1. Add a new entry to the `local custom_filter_keys` corresponding to your new filter\n1. Save ui.lua and run the game\n1. Your new filter should now be usable in the brainstorm settings"

Change your audio output (speakers to headphones, etc.) without restarting the game.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Instant Audio Device Switching**: Game audio automatically switches when you alt-tab back after changing your default audio device\n- **No Audio Interruption**: Music continues playing on the new device\n- **Zero Configuration**: Just install and play\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) (installed automatically by mod manager)\n- Windows, Linux, or macOS (*tested on Windows only*)\n\n## Important: OpenAL Soft 1.22.0+ Required\n\nThis mod requires an updated OpenAL Soft library.\n\n### Windows (Manual Step Required)\n1. Download `OpenAL32.dll` from the [mod releases](https://github.com/robertbsmith/BalatroAudioHotSwitch/releases)\n2. Copy it to your Balatro game folder (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Balatro\\`)\n3. Replace the existing file (backup original if desired)\n\n### Linux\nInstall via package manager: `sudo apt install libopenal1` (Debian/Ubuntu) or equivalent.\n\n### macOS\nInstall via Homebrew: `brew install openal-soft`\n\nThe mod manager installs the Lovely patch automatically, but you must manually install the OpenAL library.\n\n## How It Works\n\nUses OpenAL Soft's `alcReopenDeviceSOFT` function to seamlessly switch audio output when the game window regains focus. The stock Balatro OpenAL (v1.19.1) doesn't support this feature, which is why the updated library is required.\n"

            "description": "# Slay the Jokers\nA mod that allows your viewers to hover over cards on your stream to see their effects and current values.\n\nHeads up! This mod requires additional setup steps before it can work.\n\nIf you need help or have suggestions feel free to contact me at itsedalo@gmail.com.\n\n## Setup Instructions\n- **Upload Key**: To use this mod, you'll need an upload key to the Slay the Jokers server.\n1. Acquire an `upload.key` file using **one** of the following methods:\n    - Email me at `itsedalo@gmail.com`\n        - Absolutely no need for anything formal or polite, you can just say `Hi, I'm <twitch name>, give me a key.`, word for word if you want. I'll try to send you the key quickly.\n    - Use the automated system at https://edalo.net/stj/get-key (you will need to verify your Twitch account to prove it's really you)\n        - This feature is new; if something fails, fall back to emailing me\n2. Place `upload.key` in the `Balatro` data directory (`%appdata%\\Balatro`)\n3. Launch Balatro and wait for it to fully load\n    - A black command window (part of `Lovely`) will appear - don't close it\n    - On first launch, it will automatically install required tools for this mod\n4. Enable the [extension](https://dashboard.twitch.tv/extensions/iaofk5k6d87u31z9uy2joje2fwn347) on your Twitch channel\n\n## Things to Know Before Installing\n- **Stream Overlays**: This mod currently only works correctly if the game is shown at a 16:9 resolution (like 1920x1080 / 4K / 8K) and **fills the entire visible area of the stream**. Overlays that crop or reposition the game may cause card positions to misalign.\n    - If that's a dealbreaker, feel free to contact me - I might be able to make it work for your setup.\n\n- **Windows Only**: This mod currently supports only **\\*Windows\\*** systems.\n\n- **Other Mods & Compatibility**: This mod should be compatible with most other mods.\n    - Compatible mods:\n        - Reskins, QoL mods, and other non-card-related mods should work in their entirety, but have not been tested (except for the [Handy](https://github.com/SleepyG11/HandyBalatro) mod, which was confirmed to work).\n        -  Mods that add new cards should generally work, aside from some potential minor formatting quirks. Among mods that were confirmed to work are [Extra Credit](https://github.com/GuilloryCraft/ExtraCredit), [Paperback](https://github.com/Balatro-Paperback/paperback), [Neato](https://github.com/neatoqueen/NeatoJokers), [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid), and [The Balatro Multiplayer Mod](https://github.com/V-rtualized/BalatroMultiplayer).\n    - Incompatible mods:\n        - Mods that modify existing card effects are **not** compatible (the original card's effect will be shown instead).\n\n- **Disclaimer**: This mod is still under development, so some features might not work perfectly. If you encounter any issues, please let me know!\n    - *More formal disclaimer for meanies: this project is a hobby project, provided as-is, with no guarantees of stability, correctness, or suitability for any purpose. You're welcome to use it - but I take no responsibility if something goes wrong.*\n\n---\n\nIf anything is unclear or you run into issues, try referring to the [full installation guide](https://github.com/its-edalo/slay-the-jokers/blob/main/INSTALL.md).\n"

If a backup already exists, it is skipped to ensure the backup always represents the \u201coriginal\u201d localization files\n- **Skip meaningless writes**: Before writing, the merged result is normalized for newlines and trailing whitespace and compared with the existing file. If they are identical, no write or backup is performed\n- **Hot reload**: Supports execution when clicking the \u201cManual Reload\u201d button in the mod configuration menu in-game\n\n## How to Use\n\n### Method 1\n\n- Like any other mod, simply copy the entire project folder into `%AppData%/Balatro/mods`\n\n### Method 2 (Hot Reload)\n\n1. Launch the game.  \n2. Open the main menu \u2192 Mods.  \n3. Select the mod(this mod itself is **The Eighth Ocean**) and enter the `Config` tab.  \n4. Click the **Manual Reload** button to trigger merging and reload.\n\n> Note: The initial backup preserves the original files of the target mod at the moment it is triggered.  \n> To force a fresh backup of the original files, manually delete the corresponding backup files under  \n> `impl/backup/<modid>/localization/`, then click Manual Reload again.\n\n\n## Development\n\n- The merge logic is implemented in `mod.lua`, in the function `merge_impl_mod_localizations()`, which handles reading, merging, serialization, and writing.\n- To support additional mods, create a new folder under `impl/mods/` according to the modid. Refer to the existing examples for details.\n- It is recommended to ensure this mod loads with higher priority than the mods it adapts.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- `impl/mods/<modid>/localization/` \u2014 Source of your override/supplemental translations  \n- `impl/backup/<modid>/localization/` \u2014 Automatic backup of the target mod\u2019s original localization (backed up once only)  \n- Target write path: `<target_mod_path>/localization/<lang>.lua`\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- If no backup or output is generated after clicking the button, check the game startup logs (console output) for entries prefixed with `[TEOcean Language Packs]`.\n- Ensure the target mod\u2019s `localization/` directory is writable.\n- If the localization still does not take effect after merging, confirm that the selected in-game language (`G.SETTINGS.language`) matches the merged language file (e.g. `zh_CN.lua`).\n\n## License\n\n- This project is licensed under GPLv3.\n- Please comply with each mod\u2019s individual license terms. This mod only modifies the target mod\u2019s `localization` files locally; make backups when necessary and obtain the original author\u2019s permission before distribution."

This mod adds a rare black seal to the game that provides powerful negative edition effects.\n\n## How It Works\n\nWhen a card with black seal is used, it will apply **negative edition** to a random eligible joker.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Automatic Cleanup**: All other black seals in the deck will be removed when triggered (seals on cards in hand are kept)\n- **Rare Spawn**: Can be found anywhere a random seal may appear, most commonly in booster packs with a 2% base chance\n- **Configurable Spawn Rate**: The spawn chance relative to all other seals can be configured (defaults to 10%)\n- **Ectoplasm Override**: Can override the 'Ectoplasm' spectral card to add a black seal instead of its normal effect\n- **Hand Reduction Toggle**: When Ectoplasm override is active, you can also disable the hand reduction effect\n\n## Installation\n\n1. **Requirements**: Download and install [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)\n2. **Download**: Get the latest version of Black Seal from the releases\n3. **Install Location**: Extract to `%appdata%\\Balatro\\Mods` on Windows\n4. **Configuration**: Adjust spawn rates and Ectoplasm behavior through the mod settings\n\n## Configuration Options\n\n- **Spawn Rate**: Adjust how frequently black seals appear relative to other seals\n- **Ectoplasm Override**: Enable/disable replacing Ectoplasm's effect with black seal application\n- **Hand Reduction**: When using Ectoplasm override, toggle whether the hand size reduction still occurs\n\n## Credits\n\nOriginal mod created by **infarctus**. This version has been ported and updated for compatibility with newer Steamodded versions.\n\n## Support\n\nFor issues, suggestions, or contributions, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gfreitash/balatro-mods).\n"

These blinds are generally more difficult to take down compared to the other blinds, \nwith **Dawn Ordeals** being the easiest, and **Midnight Ordeals** being much a lot tougher to overcome.\n\n## Challenges\nIn some Challenges, Ordeals are guaranteed to appear.

Virtually unlimited search terms are supported.\n\nAll provided search terms must match with a card for the card to show. (e.g. `+mult, xmult` will only show jokers that give both xmult and +mult, not any joker that gives either)\n\n## Advanced uses\n\nThere are several special search terms, surrounded by braces (`{}`). These allow you to specify more about your search. They MUST come before any non-special terms.\n\n`{any}`\n\n{any} specifies that if ANY of the search terms are matched, a card will show up. Using the example above, `{any}, +mult, xmult` will show jokers that give either +mult or xmult.\n\n`{regex}`\n\n{regex} specifies that we should use Lua's pattern matcher instead of just a raw search. Keep in mind this is Lua patterns, not actual regex.\n\nAdditionally, any non-special search term can be prefixed with `!` to specify that you should NOT match that search term.\n\nA use of all these is as follows:\n\n`{any}, {regex}, legendary, cryptid, xmult.*hearts, !joker`\n\nExplanation: Any joker that is either legendary, is from cryptid, gives xmult AND has to do with hearts (assuming the xmult came first), or does not have \"joker\" anywhere in its properties.\n\nCredits to Dimserene for the idea to create this mod.\n"

Like Mods/BetmmaMods/(Betmma_Vouchers, Betmma_Jokers, lovely, ...).\n\nDirectly under Mods/ is incorrect: Mods/(Betmma_Vouchers, Betmma_Jokers, lovely, ...)\n\nThere will be a hint message in shop if installed incorrectly.\n## Discord thread\n[Here](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1225831216939536394)\n## 5 legendary challenges\nAdds 5 challenges, each featuring a legendary joker.\n\n## Betmma Jokers\nAdds 11 jokers.\n\n## Betmma Vouchers: Adds 58 Vouchers and 24 fusion Vouchers.\nVouchers have rarities. Rarity affects the chance a voucher is added into the random pool. Only vouchers added into the pool can be chosen and appear. For example, if you have redeemed all vouchers but one uncommon, rare or legendary voucher, it still can not appear. Specifically, the chances for uncommon, rare and legendary vouchers to be in the pool are 1/2, 1/4 and 1/20. Vanilla vouchers and vouchers from other mods are considered common.\n### Fusion Vouchers\nFusion Vouchers aren't fused by clicking a fusion button. Instead they appear randomly and can be bought regularly only after you have redeemed the required 2 vouchers. (May change in the future)\n## Betmma Voucher Pack: Adds 3 Voucher Packs.\n- Voucher Pack: redeem 1 of 3 vouchers.\n- Uncommon Voucher Pack: redeem 1 of 3 uncommon vouchers.\n- Fusion Voucher Pack: redeem 1 of 3 fusion vouchers.\n\nNote that if there aren't enough uncommon or fusion vouchers satisfying their requirements, random normal voucher will fill in.\n\nThis structure code is based on [Coupon Book mod](https://github.com/nicholassam6425/balatro-mods/blob/main/balamod/mods/p_coupon_book.lua) which is for Balamod. I ported it into steamodded and added lots of content.\n\n## Better Vouchers This Run UI\nRewrite the Run Info - Vouchers tab to enable it to display dozens of redeemed vouchers.\nCryptid seems to override this tab.\n\n## Betmma Abilities: Adds \"Ability\" consumable type, 28 abilities and 4 vouchers\nAbilities have their unique area. Active abilities can be used infinite times as long as they aren't on cooldown. Passive abilities are like vouchers but can be sold and revert the changes.\n\n## Betmma Spells: Adds 23 \"Spell\" cards, 1 ability and 2 vouchers\nSpell is a new type of card which triggers when certain sequence is completed. The sequence of a spell isn't fixed, instead it's randomly generated when you buy it and after buying it won't change. This is to ensure each suit and rank has the same chance to be used and prevent some suits/ranks become too op. For example before buying Light's sequence displays as \"2 different Light suits\" and after buying it'll be Heart, Diamond or Diamond, Heart.\n\nHow spells trigger: each spell has a count of how much its progress is completed. Take Heart, Diamond as example, upon buying its count is 0, and if you plays a hand of 9H, 8D, 7S, 6H, 5D, when calculating first card, 9H, its count increases as the first element of this sequence is heart and it matches the first card. This also happens for the second card, 8D. After second card is scored, the spell's count reaches 2, meaning its sequence is completed, so you gain +10 Mult and it resets count to 0. Overall this hand triggers the spell 2 times and not 3 (someone may think there are 3 pairs that are 9H-8D, 9H-5D, 6H-5D, and through the analysis above we know 9H-5D is not a pair).\n\nIf current card doesn't satisfy current element the progress won't reset. So 9H, 8D, 6H, 7S, 5D still triggers twice as 7S doesn't reset the progress.\n\nThe sequence is displayed under the spell after bought, but due to limited space it only display last completed element and next element to complete. e.g. if sequence is 7, 6, 5, then it will display either \"7, 6\" or \"6, 5\". The background of completed element is lighter than not completed one.\n\nThe element of sequence can be the following: Face cards, Numbered cards, Each suit and Each rank. There is \"negative element\" which means if the card doesn't match the element the count increases, for example \"negative Spade\" displays as \"not Spade\" and Spade icon with red background (normal elements have green background) and increases the count if current scoring card is not Spade.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTo make the system more complex :] and inspired by Doodle God game I set Dark, Light, Fire, Water, Earth and Air to be 6 basic spells, and all other spells should be fused from previous elements. e.g. Dark + Light becomes Shadow. There is a fuse button if you select two spells.\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCurrently spells appear in shop and spell pack, and fusion spells only appear if you have fused it during this run.\n"

            "description": "# Shenanigans's Decks\nThis mod currently adds 15 decks to the game (and 15 corresponding sleeves with unique effects, if using CardSleeves). You can either discover the effects yourself or read below for each deck's description.\n\n5 decks are themed after the legendary jokers:\n - **Canio Deck**: Discarded cards have a 1 in 7 (increasable by Oops! All 6s) chance to be destroyed.\n - **Triboulet Deck**: Retrigger all Kings and Queens.\n - **Yorick Deck**: Discarded cards trigger their end of round effects. This works with Mime/Red Seal.\n - **Chicot Deck**: During the Boss Blind, your rightmost Joker triggers an additional time.\n - **Perkeo Deck**: After using four consumables, get a negative copy of one of them (chosen randomly).\n\nThe other current decks are themed after existing jokers/vouchers:\n - **Dusk Deck**: -1 hand per round, but each final hand is retriggered twice.\n - **Gros Michel Deck**: The leftmost non-eternal Joker has a 1 in 6 chance to be destroyed at end of round. Start with a Gros Michel.\n - **Hieroglyph Deck**: Start at ante 0, but must reach ante 10 to win.\n - **Freaky Deck**: Jokers are now freaky. (Each Joker is assigned as a 'Freaky 6', or 'Freaky 9'. After scoring, any 'Freaky 6' adjacent to a 'Freaky 9' gives 1.5x mult)\n - **Showman Deck**: Allows duplicate cards to appear, increases odds of that happening (every card generation has a chance to take from the pool of eligible cards you have instead of the regular pool)\n - **Snakeskin Deck**: After play or discard, always draw 3 cards (constant effect of The Serpent boss blind).\n - **Turtle Bean Deck**: +5 hand size, this bonus decreases by 1 after each discard/hand played. Resets after defeating the Boss Blind.\n - **Cartomancer Deck**: Create a specific Tarot card when Blind is selected, changes each Ante (so you essentially get 3 copies of it per Ante if you don't skip).\n - **Diplopia Deck**: Start with 2 copies of each card.\n - **Riff-raff Deck**: Start with ANY random eternal joker. (instead of taking pool weights into consideration every joker has equal odds of appearing, including legendaries!) (the joker needs to have eternal compat)\n\nThere is support for Card Sleeves! Every deck has its associated sleeve with an unique effect when using it with that deck. Sleeve unique effects are:\n - **Canio Sleeve**: +1 hand size for every 5 cards destroyed.\n - **Triboulet Sleeve**: Jacks are converted into Kings or Queens (chosen randomly) (jacks effectively never appear).\n - **Yorick Sleeve**: After playing 2 hands, gain 1 discard.\n - **Chicot Sleeve**: Prevent death during the Boss Blind (once per run).\n - **Perkeo Sleeve**: The fourth consumable will always be the one copied.\n - **Dusk Sleeve**: -1 hand per round, each played card is retriggered once.\n - **Gros Michel Sleeve**: The 2nd leftmost non-eternal Joker has a 1 in 6 chance to be destroyed at end of round. +1 Joker Slot\n - **Hieroglyph Sleeve**: Start at ante -1, blind size increases by x0.2 each Ante.\n - **Freaky Sleeve**: Jokers are now freakier. (They can be assigned numbers from 0 to 9, and if adjacent jokers' numbers are ascending you get the bonus. You can also go for the 420 bonus...)\n - **Showman Sleeve**: Booster Packs always contain a card you own, if possible. (currently very likely doesn't work for modded booster packs)\n - **Snakeskin Sleeve**: Rerolling adds a card to the shop instead of replacing existing cards.\n - **Turtle Bean Sleeve**: +1 shop slots, -1 shop slots at the end of the shop. Resets after the Boss Blind.\n - **Cartomancer Sleeve**: Tarot cards you get have a 1 in 3 chance to become Negative.\n - **Diplopia Sleeve**: +1 Joker Slot. When you get a Joker, duplicate it. When a Joker is sold or destroyed, destroy all copies of it.\n - **Riff-raff Sleeve**: If the Joker from Riff-raff Deck has blueprint compat, get a copy of it. Otherwise, get ANY other random eternal Joker.\n\nSome deck textures taken from https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1238654488131272729\n"
